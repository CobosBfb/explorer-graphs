# explorer-graphs

`explorer-graphs` is a small utility to parse data from the [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia) blockchain and generate graphs. Currently, only `Active Contract Spending` is supported, but this utility can easily be extended to generate graphs for any metric tracked by the explorer's `blockFacts` strut.
